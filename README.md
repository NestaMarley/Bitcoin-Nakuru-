# Bitcoin-Nakuru-
Bitcoin Nakuru is a community of crypto enthusiasts, tech nerds, and curious locals who believe that Bitcoin isn’t just for Silicon Valley coders or Wall Street suits—it’s for everyone. Founded in 2024 by a group of Nakuru-based techies, traders, and teachers, we’re passionate about breaking down the complexities of Bitcoin and blockchain into bite-sized, easy-to-digest pieces. Think of us as your friendly neighborhood guides to the wild world of crypto, armed with a knack for storytelling and a healthy dose of humor.Our crew includes characters like:Mama Crypto, the matriarch of the group, who explains Bitcoin like she’s teaching you how to make the perfect ugali—simple, warm, and satisfying.Kiptoo the Meme Lord, who turns blockchain concepts into hilarious TikTok skits that even your grandma would get.Professor Blockchain, a local university lecturer who can make terms like “hash rate” and “decentralized ledger” sound as exciting as a safari adventure.
What We Do
Bitcoin Nakuru is all about education with a twist. We’re not here to bore you with jargon or scare you with techy mumbo-jumbo. Our goal is to make Bitcoin and blockchain so clear and fun that you’ll be explaining it to your friends over chai at the local kiosk.
